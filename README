Staccato is a racing game, developed for the 2013 edition of js13kgames.com
It was at first inspired by Supercars on Amiga, then I figured out that using WebGL meant that the viewpoint could be easily changed.
Default controls are WASD for player 1, arrow keys for player 2, F1 and Page Down to change the camera. Keys can be modified through the menu.

Submitted version has no intro music, I had to make a choice to stay below 13k.

Technologies used are WebGL for display and WebAudio for sound fx.
Rendering is called through requestAnimationFrame(), whereas game logic and sound use setInterval() to keep a (hopefully) constant refresh frequency.
Successfully tested on FF 23+ and Chrome. Slow under Opera 12 because of software rendering.
